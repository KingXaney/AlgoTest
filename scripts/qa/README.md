# Browser QA

End-to-end checks against a throwaway database. Nothing here needs a `.env`, an
API key, or a real MongoDB: the recipe starts an in-memory MongoDB, runs the dev
server with inline environment variables, and drives Google Chrome with Playwright.

Unit tests (`npm test`) cover the pure modules. This is how the database-bound
parts — server actions, Mongoose reads, the pages themselves — get exercised.

## One-time setup

```bash
cd scripts/qa
npm install            # mongodb-memory-server + playwright (kept out of the root package.json on purpose)
```

Google Chrome must be installed; the scripts use `channel: 'chrome'` so no
browser download is needed.

## Run

Three terminals from `scripts/qa`:

```bash
node start-mongo.mjs                       # 1. throwaway MongoDB on :27117 (prints READY)

MONGODB_URI='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27117/aerotrade' \
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET='local-qa-secret-at-least-32-characters-long' \
BETTER_AUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000' \
INNGEST_DEV=1 npm run dev --prefix ../..   # 2. the app, from the repo root

node qa-topics.mjs                         # 3. the checks (screenshots land in ./output)
node screenshots.mjs                       # or: capture the README screenshots
```

`qa-topics.mjs` signs up a fresh user, follows a starter topic, waits for the
first live Google News fetch, then walks the dashboard, widget library,
settings, theme picker (including the hover-sweep regression check), the ⌘K
palette, topic editing and deletion, and the chat suggestions. It exits non-zero
if any check fails and prints one `PASS`/`FAIL` line per check.

Without a Finnhub key the trade and markets pages show empty quotes, which is
fine for these checks. The Inngest jobs are not part of this recipe; fire them
with `npx inngest-cli dev` and `npm run trigger -- <job>`.
